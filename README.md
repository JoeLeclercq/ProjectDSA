 ProjectDSA

 The final project for Data Structures and Algorithms (section 3), we implement a management system for a restaurant that has a pet-allowed section and no-pets section. The user can add and remove tables, as well as manage customers who have walked in. Customers can be waiting or seated. There can only be one table with a given name in the same section, and there can only be one party with a given name in the Restaurant at one time. 

 A sample run is given on a large data set provided by Dr. Hristescu in the testing folder.
